**OTHER STUDIES** (non-RDBPC)
 
**Delta-variant SARS-CoV2 breakthrough infections following vaccination BNY162b2**  
“infectiousness protection starts diminishing for patients two months post vaccination and ultimately vanishes for patients 6 months or longer post vaccination.”

**Waning immunity of the BNT162b2 vaccine: A nationwide study from Israel**  
“Conclusions These results indicate a strong effect of waning immunity in all age groups after six months.”

**Long-term immunogenicity of BNT162b2 vaccination in the elderly and in younger...**  
“Collectively, these findings suggest that the established two-dose vaccination regimen elicits less durable immune responses in the elderly compared to young adults.”

**Emerging Evidence Efficacy of Ivermectin in the Prophylaxis and Treatment of COVID-19**  
“Meta-analyses based on 18 randomized controlled treatment trials of ivermectin in COVID-19 have found large, statistically significant reductions in mortality, time to clinical recovery, and time to viral clearance.”

**Comparing SARS-CoV-2 natural immunity to vaccine-induced immunity**
"This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity."
