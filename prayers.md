Morning Prayers
---

**Marian Prayer of Mother Teresa**  
Give us a heart as beautiful, pure, and spotless as yours. 
A heart like yours, so full of love and humility. 
May we be able to receive Jesus as the Bread of Life, 
to love Him as you loved Him, 
to serve Him under the mistreated face of the poor. 
We ask this through Jesus Christ our Lord.

**Morning Consecration**  
Mary, I want to be a saint.
I know that you also want me to be a saint
and that it's your God-given mission to form me into one.
So, Mary, at this moment, on this day,
I freely choose to give you my full permission to do your work in me,
with your Spouse, the Holy Spirit.

**Saint Joseph**  
Dear Patron of God's Church,
you are honored by her as the Worker,
the humble carpenter of Nazareth.
According to St. Teresa of Avila,
you are universal in your intercessions.
Inspire workers of all kinds
to walk ever in your footsteps as faithful servants
coupling charity with justice
and becoming true followers of Jesus.

**St. Michael the Archangel**  
St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. 
Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the Devil. 
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God, 
thrust into hell Satan, and all the evil spirits, who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls.   
Amen.

**Hail Holy Queen**  
Hail, holy Queen, Mother of mercy, hail, our life, our sweetness and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve: to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this vale of tears. Turn then, most gracious Advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus, O merciful, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary! Amen.  

**Memorare**  
Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary,
that never was it known that anyone who fled to your protection,
implored your help, or sought your intercession,
was left unaided.
Inspired by this confidence,
I fly unto you, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother.
To you do I come, before you I stand, sinful and sorrowful.
O Mother of the Word Incarnate,
despise not my petitions,
but in your mercy, hear and answer me.
Amen.

**Year of St Joseph**  
*Father - Protector - Consoler*  
O St. Joseph, at Fatima, you appeared as head of the Holy Family and with the Child Jesus, blessed the world and all its inhabitants. As the greatest consoler of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, we beseech you to assist us in our devotion to your beloved spouse, especially in our First Saturday reparations, which console our heavenly Mother. As the faithful father and protector of Mary and Jesus, we implore your powerful intercession in helping us to restore marriage and family to right order with God. With your spiritual carpenter skills, rebuild our Church and guide those who have strayed, back to our Eucharistic Lord. Assist us in spreading the message of Our Lady of Fatima, and help us to do our part in bringing about the triumph she promised. Amen.  

**Memorare to St Joseph**  
Remember, O most chaste spouse of the Virgin Mary,
that never was it known that anyone who implored your help and
sought your intercession were left unassisted.
Full of confidence in your power
I fly unto you and beg your protection.
Despise not O Guardian of the Redeemer my humble supplication,
but in your bounty, hear and answer me. Amen.  

**Thomas Merton Prayer**  
My Lord God, I have no idea where I am going.  
I do not see the road ahead of me.  
I cannot know for certainÂ where it will end.  
Nor do I really know myself,   
and the fact that I think I am following Your will does not mean that I am actually doing so.   
But I believe that the desire to please You does in fact please you.  
And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing.  
I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire.  
And I know that, if I do this, You will lead me by the right road,  
though I may know nothing about it.  
Therefore I will trust You always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death.  
I will not fear, for You are ever with me,  
and You will never leave me to face my perils alone.   

**Our Lady of Sorrows**  
*Prayer to Our Sorrowful Mother*  

O Mother of Sorrows, thou, who beneath the Cross of Jesus were given to us as our Mother, look down with pity on us, thy children, who weep and mourn in this valley of tears. By that sword of sorrow which pierced thy Heart when thou looked upon the Face of thy dead Son, obtain for us that comfort we so sorely need in our sufferings.

Thou were given to us our Mother in the hour of thy greatest grief that thou might be mindful of our frailty and the evils that press upon us. Without thy aid, O Sorrowful Mother, we cannot gain the victory in this struggle against flesh and blood. Therefore, we seek thy help, O Queen of Sorrows, lest we fall prey to the wiles of the enemy. We are orphans in need of the guiding hand of our Mother amid the dangers that threaten our destruction. Thou whose grief was boundless as the sea, grant us by the memory of those sorrows the strength to be victorious.

Intercede further, O Mother of Sorrows, for us and all who are near and dear to us, that we may ever do the Will of thy Son, and may direct all our actions to His honor, and to the furtherance of devotion to thy sorrows.
Amen.

Virgin Most Sorrowful, pray for us.

Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be.

I send them immediately and directly to the foot of the Cross to be judged, never to bother us again. come, Holy Spirit, and descend upon our home and fill us (name loved ones) with your light and love. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
