### Apostle's Creed
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth;  
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son Our Lord,  
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.  
He descended into Hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;  
He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.  
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.  
Amen.

### Glory Be
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.  
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end.  
Amen.  

### Fatima Prayer
O my Jesus, forgive us our sins; save us from the fires of hell. 
Lead all souls to Heaven, especially those who are most in need.

### Hail, holy Queen
Hail, holy Queen, Mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.  
V. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.  
R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.  

### Let us pray
O God, whose only begotten Son, by His life, death, and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life. Grant, we beseech Thee, that by meditating on these mysteries of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
Pour forth we beseech Thee, O Lord, Thy grace into our hearts, that we to whom the incarnation of Christ, Thy Son, was made known by the message of an angel, may by His passion and cross be brought to the glory of His resurrection, through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.

### Sign of the Cross
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

### History
The use of prayer beads pre-dates Christianity and common amoung religions. There is a tradition that Mary gave this prayer to Saint Dominic in 1221, calling it her Psalter. The 150 Hail Mary's were more accessible to the laity compared to the 150 Psalms. The fifteen mysteries in use today were officially established by Pope Pius V in 1569. In 1917, Mary appeared to three children at Fatim under the title Our Lady of the Rosary. She asked for five first Saturdays reparations for the five offenses against her Immaculate Heart. For each Saturday she asked us to go to confession, receive Holy Communion, recite the Rosary, and meditate for 15 minutes on the 15 mysteries of the Rosary. Rosary comes from Latin *rosarium* meaning rose garden, or bouquet of roses.
