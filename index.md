[Archbishop Fulton Sheen - Signs of Our Times](https://gloria.tv/post/8apV1vmiq9kEBvpUHBc7hzDg7)  
>1947 (Gloria.tv) As for Jews, Protestants and Catholics alike an alliance is necessary not to fight against an external enemy, for our “wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places,” (Ephesians 6:12) but rather a unity on the basis of men of good will, who believe in the moral law, the family, God and the Divinity of Christ. It is not a unity of religion we plead for that is impossible when purchased at the cost of the unity of truth, but a unity of religious peoples, wherein each marches separately according to the light of his conscience, but strikes together for the moral betterment of the world, through prayer, not hate. We may not be able to meet in the same pew - would to God we did - but we can meet on our knees. You may be sure that no sordid compromises nor carrying of waters on both shoulders will see you through.
