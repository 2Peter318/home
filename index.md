[Two Stanford Doctors Blast the Nation’s COVID Response – “Worst Public Health Mistake In Last 100 Years”](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/03/two-stanford-doctors-blast-nations-covid-response-worst-public-health-mistake-last-100-years/)  
>March 12, 2021 - I stand behind my comment that the lockdowns are the single worst public health mistake in the last 100 years. We will be counting the catastrophic health and psychological harms, imposed on nearly every poor person on the face of the earth, for a generation.

>At the same time, they have not served to control the epidemic in the places where they have been most vigorously imposed. In the US, they have – at best – protected the “non-essential” class from COVID, while exposing the essential working class to the disease. The lockdowns are trickle down epidemiology.

>“The other idea is that the lockdowns themselves impose great harm on people. Lockdowns are not a natural normal way to live.”

[Doctors, pro-life leaders demand stop to justifying use of abortion-tainted vaccines](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/women-doctors-pro-life-leaders-demand-stop-to-justifying-use-of-abortion-tainted-vaccines)  
>*March 9, 2021* (LifeSiteNews) — An international coalition of nearly 100 women doctors, consecrated religious, and pro-life leaders have issued a bold appeal to Christians and all people of goodwill to cease morally justifying the use of abortion-tainted vaccines, arguing that failure to stand up against them is fueling an expanding culture of death involving the trafficking and exploitation of aborted babies for medical experimentation.

[Father Absence Crisis Infographic](https://www.fatherhood.org/fatherhood/the-father-absence-crisis-infographic)  
>*28 Feb 2021* (Fatherhood.org) — There is a crisis in America. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 24 million children in America—one out of three—live without their biological dad in the home. Consequently, there is a “father factor” in nearly all of the societal issues facing America today. The good news is, we can all help. How? By focusing on creating generations of responsible, involved fathers.  

[Adapting to Our Brave New World](https://www.crisismagazine.com/2021/adapting-to-our-brave-new-world)  
>*04 Feb 2021* (Crisis Magazine) — We would all like to believe that things will turn around. I know I do. But we must look at our present crisis in the light of history. Our current times have many parallels to other times of crisis, such as the French or Bolshevik Revolutions. Christians in those times were surrounded by darkness, so they knew they had to adapt to keep the faith. So do we. Fortunately, we embrace a faith that is not afraid of the darkness, because we have a Lord who overcame it. As long as we trust in Him, so will we.

[Why Catholics Should Care About Bitcoin](https://www.crisismagazine.com/2021/why-catholics-should-care-about-bitcoin)  
>*26 Feb 2021* (Crisis Magazine) — As I write this, there are thousands of projects in the works to apply blockchain technology to decentralize services such as [search engines](https://www.presearch.io/), [video hosting](https://lbry.tv/), and [payment processing](https://www.dash.org/). If these projects are successful, then there’s no more need for Google, YouTube, or Paypal, all of which have already shown a propensity to discriminate against faithful Catholics. And of course Bitcoin itself can be a means of financial savings that cannot be confiscated if one day your bank decides your “dangerous” Catholic beliefs make you unworthy of keeping your own money.

[COVID Cases Plummet After WHO Changes Testing Protocol](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/covid-cases-plummet-after-who-changes-testing-protocol-on-bidens-inauguration-day)  
>*Feb 2021* (LifeSiteNews) — On January 20, the day of Joe Biden’s inauguration and entrance into the White House, the World Health Organization (WHO) quietly issued new guidance on the manner in which polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were to be conducted and reported. It warned against reporting someone as having COVID-19, just because the test had been positive, when they did not actually present with any symptoms. The WHO also raised concerns about the “risk of false positive” tests. In a surprising statement, the WHO described PCR tests merely as an “aid for diagnosis” without placing any greater weight upon the results of PCR tests, pointing the testers to examine real life evidence, such as symptoms.*

[Archbishop Fulton Sheen - Signs of Our Times](https://gloria.tv/post/8apV1vmiq9kEBvpUHBc7hzDg7)  
>1947 (Gloria.tv) As for Jews, Protestants and Catholics alike an alliance is necessary not to fight against an external enemy, for our “wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places,” (Ephesians 6:12) but rather a unity on the basis of men of good will, who believe in the moral law, the family, God and the Divinity of Christ. It is not a unity of religion we plead for that is impossible when purchased at the cost of the unity of truth, but a unity of religious peoples, wherein each marches separately according to the light of his conscience, but strikes together for the moral betterment of the world, through prayer, not hate. We may not be able to meet in the same pew - would to God we did - but we can meet on our knees. You may be sure that no sordid compromises nor carrying of waters on both shoulders will see you through.  

[We'll Have Herd Immunity by April - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/well-have-herd-immunity-by-april-11613669731)  
>*18 Feb 2021* (WSJ) — Covid cases have dropped 77% in six weeks. Experts should level with the public about the good news. Why is the number of cases plummeting much faster than experts predicted? In large part because natural immunity from prior infection is far more common than can be measured by testing. Testing has been capturing only from 10% to 25% of infections, depending on when during the pandemic someone got the virus. Applying a time-weighted case capture average of 1 in 6.5 to the cumulative 28 million confirmed cases would mean about 55% of Americans have natural immunity.
