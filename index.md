[Archbishop Fulton Sheen - Signs of Our Times](https://gloria.tv/post/8apV1vmiq9kEBvpUHBc7hzDg7)  
>1947 (Gloria.tv) As for Jews, Protestants and Catholics alike an alliance is necessary not to fight against an external enemy, for our “wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places,” (Ephesians 6:12) but rather a unity on the basis of men of good will, who believe in the moral law, the family, God and the Divinity of Christ. It is not a unity of religion we plead for that is impossible when purchased at the cost of the unity of truth, but a unity of religious peoples, wherein each marches separately according to the light of his conscience, but strikes together for the moral betterment of the world, through prayer, not hate. We may not be able to meet in the same pew - would to God we did - but we can meet on our knees. You may be sure that no sordid compromises nor carrying of waters on both shoulders will see you through.  

[We'll Have Herd Immunity by April - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/well-have-herd-immunity-by-april-11613669731)  
>*18 Feb 2021* (WSJ) — Covid cases have dropped 77% in six weeks. Experts should level with the public about the good news. Why is the number of cases plummeting much faster than experts predicted? In large part because natural immunity from prior infection is far more common than can be measured by testing. Testing has been capturing only from 10% to 25% of infections, depending on when during the pandemic someone got the virus. Applying a time-weighted case capture average of 1 in 6.5 to the cumulative 28 million confirmed cases would mean about 55% of Americans have natural immunity.

[Doctors, pro-life leaders demand stop to justifying use of abortion-tainted vaccines](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/women-doctors-pro-life-leaders-demand-stop-to-justifying-use-of-abortion-tainted-vaccines)  
>*March 9, 2021* (LifeSiteNews) — An international coalition of nearly 100 women doctors, consecrated religious, and pro-life leaders have issued a bold appeal to Christians and all people of goodwill to cease morally justifying the use of abortion-tainted vaccines, arguing that failure to stand up against them is fueling an expanding culture of death involving the trafficking and exploitation of aborted babies for medical experimentation.
